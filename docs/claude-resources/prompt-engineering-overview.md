# Prompt Engineering Overview

_Comprehensive guide to effective prompt engineering with Claude_

## Introduction

Prompt engineering is the art and science of crafting inputs that guide AI models to produce desired outputs. This overview covers fundamental principles, advanced techniques, and best practices for working with Claude.

## Core Prompt Engineering Principles

### 1. Clarity and Directness

**Be explicit about expectations**

```text
Good: "Analyze this data and provide three key insights with supporting evidence"
Poor: "Look at this data and tell me what you think"
```

**Use specific language**

```text
Good: "Summarize in exactly 3 bullet points"
Poor: "Give me a short summary"
```

### 2. Structure and Organization

**Messages API Structure**

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Your structured prompt here"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Essential Elements Order**:

1. Task context (role and goals)
2. Tone context (communication style)
3. Input data (with XML tags)
4. Examples (ideal responses)
5. Immediate task (specific request)

## Prompt Architecture Framework

### 10-Element Prompt Structure

```python
######################################## PROMPT ELEMENTS ########################################

##### Element 1: User Role
# Always start Messages API calls with user role
# The get_completion() function handles this automatically

##### Element 2: Task Context
# Define Claude's role and overarching goals
# Place early in prompt for maximum effectiveness
TASK_CONTEXT = "You are an expert data analyst specializing in business intelligence."

##### Element 3: Tone Context
# Specify desired communication style
# Optional but important for consistent interactions
TONE_CONTEXT = "Maintain a professional, analytical tone with actionable insights."

##### Element 4: Detailed Task Description and Rules
# Expand on specific tasks and constraints
# Include "outs" for unknown information
TASK_DESCRIPTION = """
Key requirements:
- Focus on quantitative analysis
- Highlight trends and patterns
- Provide confidence levels for predictions
- If data is insufficient, clearly state limitations
"""

##### Element 5: Examples
# Most effective tool for desired behavior
# Use <example></example> XML tags
# Include edge cases and variations
EXAMPLES = """
<example>
User: What are the sales trends?
Assistant: Based on the Q3 data analysis:
• Revenue increased 15% QoQ (95% confidence)
• Customer acquisition costs decreased 8%
• Seasonal patterns suggest 12% growth in Q4
</example>
"""

##### Element 6: Input Data
# Structure with XML tags for clarity
# Support multiple data sources
INPUT_DATA = f"""
<sales_data>
{SALES_METRICS}
</sales_data>

<customer_data>
{CUSTOMER_METRICS}
</customer_data>
"""

##### Element 7: Immediate Task
# Reiterate specific expectations
# Place near end for emphasis
IMMEDIATE_TASK = "Analyze the provided data and identify the top 3 opportunities for growth."

##### Element 8: Precognition (Step-by-Step Thinking)
# Encourage systematic approach
# Particularly useful for complex tasks
PRECOGNITION = "Think through your analysis step by step before providing recommendations."

##### Element 9: Output Formatting
# Specify desired response structure
# Place toward end of prompt
OUTPUT_FORMATTING = """
Format your response as:
<analysis>Your detailed analysis</analysis>
<recommendations>Your top 3 recommendations</recommendations>
"""

##### Element 10: Prefilling (Assistant Response Start)
# Steer initial response direction
# Must be in assistant role
PREFILL = "<analysis>"
```

## Advanced Prompting Techniques

### XML-Based Data Structure

**Benefits of XML Tags**:

- Clear separation between instructions and data
- Support for nested information
- Improved parsing accuracy
- Structured output formatting

**Example Implementation**:

```xml
<documents>
  <document index="1">
    <source>quarterly_report.pdf</source>
    <document_content>
      {{REPORT_CONTENT}}
    </document_content>
  </document>
  <document index="2">
    <source>market_analysis.xlsx</source>
    <document_content>
      {{ANALYSIS_CONTENT}}
    </document_content>
  </document>
</documents>

Analyze both documents and identify strategic synergies.
```

### Chain of Thought Prompting

**Encourage Systematic Reasoning**:

```text
Think about this problem step by step:
1. First, identify the key variables
2. Then, analyze their relationships
3. Next, consider potential solutions
4. Finally, recommend the best approach with rationale
```

**Example with Medical Diagnosis**:

```xml
<patient_data>
{{SYMPTOMS_AND_HISTORY}}
</patient_data>

Please diagnose this case by:
1. Identifying key symptoms in <symptoms> tags
2. Considering differential diagnoses in <differentials> tags
3. Providing your final diagnosis in <diagnosis> tags
4. Explaining your reasoning in <rationale> tags
```

### Few-Shot Learning with Examples

**Single Example (One-Shot)**:

```xml
<example>
Input: "Revenue last quarter"
Output: Q3 2024 revenue was $2.3M, representing 12% growth YoY
</example>

Now process: "Profit margins this year"
```

**Multiple Examples (Few-Shot)**:

```xml
<examples>
<example>
Query: Weather in Paris
Response: Current weather in Paris: 18°C, partly cloudy, 65% humidity
</example>

<example>
Query: Time in Tokyo
Response: Current time in Tokyo: 3:45 PM JST (UTC+9)
</example>
</examples>

Query: Population of London
```

## Specialized Prompting Patterns

### Role-Playing Prompts

**Expert Personas**:

```text
You are a senior software architect with 15 years of experience in distributed systems.
Your specialty is designing scalable microservices architectures.

When reviewing code, you focus on:
- System reliability and fault tolerance
- Performance optimization opportunities
- Security considerations
- Code maintainability and documentation
```

### Conversational Context Management

**History Preservation**:

```python
INPUT_DATA = f"""
<conversation_history>
{PREVIOUS_CONTEXT}
</conversation_history>

<current_question>
{USER_QUESTION}
</current_question>

Respond in context of our ongoing conversation.
"""
```

### Multi-Turn Reasoning

**Building on Previous Responses**:

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Analyze this market data for trends"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "I found three key trends: [analysis]"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Now predict next quarter's performance based on those trends"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### Issue 1: Ambiguous Instructions

**Problem**: Vague prompts lead to inconsistent results

```text
❌ "Make this better"
✅ "Improve readability by: adding section headers, using bullet points, and reducing sentence length to under 20 words"
```

### Issue 2: Context Mixing

**Problem**: Instructions mixed with data

```text
❌ "Analyze this data: Q1 sales were $100K tell me the trends"
✅ "Analyze the following data for trends:
<data>Q1 sales were $100K</data>"
```

### Issue 3: Missing Examples

**Problem**: Complex tasks without guidance

```text
❌ "Format this as a professional report"
✅ "Format as a professional report following this example:
<example>
# Executive Summary
Key findings: [bullet points]
# Detailed Analysis
[structured sections]
</example>"
```

## Performance Optimization

### Token Efficiency

**Minimize Redundancy**:

- Use clear, concise language
- Avoid repeating information
- Structure data efficiently

**Smart Context Management**:

- Include only relevant context
- Use summaries for long histories
- Leverage prompt caching for repeated elements

### Response Quality

**Quality Assurance Techniques**:

1. **Validation prompts**: Ask Claude to check its work
2. **Multi-step verification**: Break complex tasks into steps
3. **Confidence scoring**: Request certainty levels
4. **Alternative approaches**: Ask for multiple solutions

## Testing and Iteration

### Prompt Testing Framework

```python
def test_prompt_effectiveness(prompt_template, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        response = get_completion(prompt_template.format(**test_case))
        score = evaluate_response(response, test_case.expected)
        results.append({
            'input': test_case,
            'response': response,
            'score': score
        })
    return analyze_results(results)
```

### Continuous Improvement

1. **A/B test** different prompt versions
2. **Monitor** response quality metrics
3. **Collect** user feedback on outputs
4. **Iterate** based on performance data
5. **Document** successful patterns

## Integration Best Practices

### API Implementation

```python
def create_optimized_prompt(task_context, input_data, examples=None):
    """Build structured prompt with all elements"""
    prompt_parts = [
        f"Task: {task_context}",
        f"<input_data>{input_data}</input_data>"
    ]

    if examples:
        prompt_parts.append(f"<examples>{examples}</examples>")

    return "\n\n".join(prompt_parts)
```

### Error Handling

```python
def robust_completion(prompt, max_retries=3):
    """Handle API errors and retry with backoff"""
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return get_completion(prompt)
        except RateLimitError:
            time.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff
        except Exception as e:
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                raise e
    return None
```
