## Quick Start

Install directly from Claude Code:

```bash
# Inside Claude Code, run:
/plugin install https://github.com/ItamarZand88/claude-code-agentic-engineering

# Verify installation
/help    # Should show /agi:* commands
```

That's it! All commands are available with the `/agi:` prefix.

## Why Use This Plugin?

✅ **Zero Configuration** - Install once, use everywhere
✅ **Proven Workflow** - Structured 4-step process from idea to implementation
✅ **AI Agent Team** - 3 specialized agents for exploration, architecture, and code review
✅ **Quality Built-In** - Automated code review, best practices compliance, security checks
✅ **Speed & Efficiency** - Parallel agent execution, command chaining, auto-continue workflow
✅ **Organized** - All task artifacts automatically organized in `.claude/tasks/`
✅ **Research-Driven** - Web research integration for best practices and patterns

## What This Gives You

Transform your development workflow with a **4-step core workflow** plus **setup commands** and **3 specialized AI agents** that work together to create a comprehensive engineering system.

### The Complete Workflow

```bash
# 1. Comprehensive task ticket creation with deep analysis
/agi:1_ticket "Add OAuth integration with Google"

# 2. Research-driven implementation planning
/agi:2_plan .claude/tasks/add-oauth-integration

# 3. Execute implementation following the plan
/agi:3_implement .claude/tasks/add-oauth-integration

# 4. Comprehensive quality review and validation
/agi:4_review .claude/tasks/add-oauth-integration
```

Or run the full workflow in one command:
```bash
/agi:all "Add OAuth integration with Google"
```

All task artifacts are organized in the `.claude/` directory:
```
.claude/
├── tasks/
│   └── {task-name}/
│       ├── ticket.md     # Task requirements and acceptance criteria
│       ├── plan.md       # Research-driven implementation plan
│       └── review.md     # Code review and quality assessment
├── best-practices/
│   └── README.md         # Project coding best practices (generated by skill)
└── skills/
    ├── best-practices-extractor/  # Extract best practices from PRs
    └── code-compliance/           # Validate code against best practices
```

## Plugin Commands

All commands use the `/agi:` prefix:

### Core Workflow Commands

| Command | Purpose | Key Features |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `/agi:1_ticket <description>` | Task ticket creation | Deep codebase analysis, parallel agent coordination, clarification questions, comprehensive requirements |
| `/agi:2_plan <task_folder>` | Implementation planning | Web research, architecture decisions, phase-based breakdown, pattern discovery |
| `/agi:3_implement <task_folder>` | Execute implementation | Direct implementation, git management, testing validation, progress tracking |
| `/agi:4_review <task_folder>` | Quality assurance | Automated QA checks, best practices compliance, security & performance analysis |

### Setup & Utility Commands

| Command | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `/agi:all <description>` | Complete workflow | Run all 4 steps in sequence - fastest way to go from idea to implementation |
| `/agi:best-practices` | Generate best practices | Extract project-specific coding standards from PRs |
| `/agi:checks` | Run quality checks | TypeScript, Prettier, Lint validation |
| `/agi:fix-pr-comments <pr_number>` | Fix PR review comments | Address code review feedback |

## Specialized Agents

The plugin includes **3 specialized AI agents** that handle the complete development lifecycle:

### 1. Code Explorer
**Used in:** `/agi:1_ticket` (analysis phase)

Deeply analyzes existing codebase features by tracing execution paths, mapping architecture layers, understanding patterns and abstractions, and documenting dependencies to inform new development.

**Key capabilities:**
- Traces feature implementations from entry points to data storage
- Maps architecture layers (presentation → business logic → data)
- Identifies design patterns and architectural decisions
- Documents dependencies and integration points
- Provides file:line references for all findings

### 2. Code Architect
**Used in:** `/agi:2_plan` (design phase)

Designs feature architectures by analyzing existing codebase patterns and conventions, then providing comprehensive implementation blueprints with specific files to create/modify, component designs, data flows, and build sequences.

**Key capabilities:**
- Extracts and applies existing codebase patterns
- Makes decisive architectural decisions with clear rationale
- Designs complete component structures and data flows
- Creates phased implementation plans with specific tasks
- Ensures seamless integration with existing code

### 3. Code Reviewer
**Used in:** `/agi:4_review` (quality assurance phase)

Reviews code for bugs, logic errors, security vulnerabilities, code quality issues, and adherence to project conventions and `.claude/best-practices/`, using confidence-based filtering to report only high-priority issues.

**Key capabilities:**
- Loads and enforces project-specific best practices
- Identifies critical bugs, security vulnerabilities, and logic errors
- Runs automated checks (linting, type-checking, formatting)
- Confidence scoring (only reports issues ≥80% confidence)
- Provides concrete fixes with code examples

# Follow the 4-step workflow
/agi:1_ticket "Add dark mode toggle to the header"
/agi:2_plan .claude/tasks/add-dark-mode-toggle
/agi:3_implement .claude/tasks/add-dark-mode-toggle
/agi:4_review .claude/tasks/add-dark-mode-toggle
```

### Complex System Integration

### Complete Workflow (All in One)
```bash
# Run all 4 steps sequentially - fastest way to ship!
/agi:all "Add user authentication with email verification"
```

### Command Chaining (Auto-Continue)

Use the `--continue` flag to automatically chain commands:

```bash
# Create ticket and auto-continue to planning
/agi:1_ticket "Add feature" --continue=plan

# Create ticket and run full workflow through implementation
/agi:1_ticket "Add feature" --continue=implement

# Create ticket and run complete workflow including review
/agi:1_ticket "Add feature" --continue=all
```

### Quality & Best Practices
```bash
# Generate project-specific best practices from PRs
/agi:best-practices

# Run quality checks (TypeScript, Prettier, Lint)
/agi:checks

# Fix PR review comments
/agi:fix-pr-comments 123
```

## Customization

The AGI plugin is fully extensible and customizable:

### For Plugin Users

1. **Fork the repository** and modify the files in `plugin/`
2. **Install your forked version**:
   ```bash
   /plugin install https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/claude-code-agentic-engineering
   ```

### For Contributors

1. **Modify command behavior**: Edit files in `plugin/commands/`
2. **Customize agent expertise**: Update files in `plugin/agents/`
3. **Add new commands**: Create new `.md` files in `plugin/commands/`
4. **Create specialized agents**: Add domain-specific agents to `plugin/agents/`

All commands and agents use XML-structured prompts for optimal Claude performance.

## Core Principles

### XML-Structured Prompts
All prompts use XML tags for clear organization:
```xml
<instruction>
Clear task description
</instruction>

<context>
Relevant background information
</context>

<thinking>
Step-by-step reasoning process
</thinking>

<output>
Expected output format
</output>
```

### Task-First Approach
1. Start with clear requirements (`/1_ticket`)
2. Research and plan thoroughly (`/2_plan`)
3. Execute with validation (`/3_implement`)
4. Review comprehensively (`/4_review`)

### Knowledge Preservation
- All decisions documented in task folders
- Best practices captured in `.claude/best-practices/`
- Patterns discovered and reused
- Context maintained across tasks
