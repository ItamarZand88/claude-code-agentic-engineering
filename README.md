## Quick Start

```bash
# Install in existing project
uvx --from git+https://github.com/ItamarZand88/claude-code-agentic-engineering.git agentic install

# Start Claude Code and verify installation
claude
/help    # Should show your new commands
```

### Even Easier with Aliases!

Tired of typing the long command? Set up a short alias:

**PowerShell (Windows):**
```powershell
# Run once to set up
.\setup-aliases.ps1

# Now use the short command
agi
```

**Bash/Zsh (Linux/Mac):**
```bash
# Run once to set up
source setup-aliases.sh

# Now use the short command
agi
```

See [ALIASES.md](ALIASES.md) for permanent setup instructions.

### All Installation Options

```bash
# Initialize new project
uvx --from git+https://github.com/ItamarZand88/claude-code-agentic-engineering.git agentic init my-project

# Install in existing project
uvx --from git+https://github.com/ItamarZand88/claude-code-agentic-engineering.git agentic install

# Check installation status
uvx --from git+https://github.com/ItamarZand88/claude-code-agentic-engineering.git agentic status
```

## What This Gives You

Transform your development workflow with a **4-step core workflow** plus **setup commands** and **7 specialized AI agents** that work together to create a comprehensive engineering system.

### The Complete Workflow

```bash
# 1. Comprehensive task ticket creation with deep analysis
/1_ticket "Add OAuth integration with Google"

# 2. Research-driven implementation planning
/2_plan .claude/tasks/add-oauth-integration

# 3. Execute implementation following the plan
/3_implement .claude/tasks/add-oauth-integration

# 4. Comprehensive quality review and validation
/4_review .claude/tasks/add-oauth-integration
```

All task artifacts are organized in the `.claude/` directory:
```
.claude/
├── tasks/
│   └── {task-name}/
│       ├── ticket.md     # Task requirements and acceptance criteria
│       ├── plan.md       # Research-driven implementation plan
│       └── review.md     # Code review and quality assessment
├── best-practices/
│   └── README.md         # Project coding best practices (generated by skill)
└── skills/
    ├── best-practices-extractor/  # Extract best practices from PRs
    └── code-compliance/           # Validate code against best practices
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Feature Development
```bash
# Follow the 4-step workflow
/1_ticket "Add dark mode toggle to the header"
/2_plan .claude/tasks/add-dark-mode-toggle
/3_implement .claude/tasks/add-dark-mode-toggle
/4_review .claude/tasks/add-dark-mode-toggle
```

### Complex System Integration
```bash
# Create comprehensive ticket with deep analysis
/1_ticket "Integrate Stripe payments with subscription management"

# Research-driven planning
/2_plan .claude/tasks/integrate-stripe-payments

# Execute implementation
/3_implement .claude/tasks/integrate-stripe-payments

# Comprehensive review
/4_review .claude/tasks/integrate-stripe-payments
```

### Complete Workflow (All in One)
```bash
# Run all 4 steps sequentially
/all "Add user authentication with email verification"
```

### Quality & Best Practices
```bash
# Run quality checks
/checks

# Fix PR review comments
/fix-pr-comments 123
```

## Customization

All commands and agents are fully customizable:

1. **Modify command behavior** by editing files in `commands/`
2. **Customize agent expertise** by updating files in `agents/`
3. **Add new commands** by creating new `.md` files in `.claude/commands/`
4. **Create specialized agents** for your domain-specific needs

Each command and agent uses XML-structured prompts for optimal Claude performance.

## Core Principles

### XML-Structured Prompts
All prompts use XML tags for clear organization:
```xml
<instruction>
Clear task description
</instruction>

<context>
Relevant background information
</context>

<thinking>
Step-by-step reasoning process
</thinking>

<output>
Expected output format
</output>
```

### Task-First Approach
1. Start with clear requirements (`/1_ticket`)
2. Research and plan thoroughly (`/2_plan`)
3. Execute with validation (`/3_implement`)
4. Review comprehensively (`/4_review`)

### Knowledge Preservation
- All decisions documented in task folders
- Best practices captured in `.claude/best-practices/`
- Patterns discovered and reused
- Context maintained across tasks
